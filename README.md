# Weather app server

This is a simple server implementation using Express, and forms part of my Weather project which can be found [here](https://github.com/PhilipVigus/weather-app). Please view the readme of the linked repository for details of how to use this server.

It provides two routes to the weather application.

- the first gives JSON data containing all locations with the requested initial letter
- the second gives the full name of the location with the requested id
